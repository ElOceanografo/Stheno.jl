# Examples: Getting Started

These examples demonstrate how the basic manipulations of Gaussian processes available in this package in `basic_operations.jl`. 

`high_level_plotting.jl` shows how to effectively combine `Plots.jl` with this package to quickly generate plots for 1D input spaces, while `low_level_plotting.jl` provides an example of the same plotting command, but without any of the high-level plotting utilities provided by this package -- this is important if the high-level plotting utilities aren't suitable for your application.
